# COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS
This repo is an updated version of my previous `computational-physics-I`repository. I decided to gather all the content regarding computational physics together to avoid creating multiple repositories, and keep everything organised in one place. In this version I've not only included `Notebooks` but also `Python` scripts. This way, you can also learn how to write scripts in Python and run them in your terminal.

This collection is designed to aid fellow students in their learning journey. Please feel free to explore the notes posted here, and if you have any questions, suggestions for improvements, or corrections, don't hesitate to open a pull request.

#### Important Note:
- **Code Usage:** The code provided in this repository is intended as a guide for your learning process. Avoid copying the code directly; instead, use it as a reference while understanding the physical interpretation of each problem. As responsible students and future physicists, it is crucial to test your coding abilities by independently solving and implementing the solutions.

## Content 
1. [Computational Physics I](./computational-physics-I)

2. [Computational Physics II](./computational-physics-II)


3. [Special Topics on Computational Physics](./special-topics-comp-phys)

## Contributing 
Your contributions are highly appreciated. If you find any errors, have suggestions for improvements, or want to add more content, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Make your modifications and commit them.
4. Push the changes to your fork.
5. Open a pull request, describing the changes you've made.

In the long run, I plan to rewrite some impotant modules in C++ and Rust, so it can be used as a reference for students who are interested in learning these languages.
    
Happy coding and learning!
